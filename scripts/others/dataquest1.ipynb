    "### 1: The Competition\n",
    "We'll be learning how to generate a submission for a Kaggle competition. Kaggle is a site where you create algorithms, and compete against machine learning practitioners around the world. Your algorithm wins if it's the most accurate on a given dataset. Kaggle is a fun way to practice your machine learning skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle has several different competitions on their site. On of them is about predicting which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic. In this and the next mission, we'll be learning how to make our first submission to the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data is in .csv format. You can get started with the competition and download the data here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row represents a passenger on the Titanic, and some information about them. Let's take a look at the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- PassengerId -- A numerical id assigned to each passenger.\n",
    "- Survived -- Whether the passenger survived (1), or didn't (0). We'll be making predictions for this column.\n",
    "- Pclass* -- The class the passenger was in -- first class (1), second class (2), or third class (3).\n",
    "- Name -- the name of the passenger.\n",
    "- Sex -- The gender of the passenger -- male or female.\n",
    "- Age -- The age of the passenger. Fractional.\n",
    "- SibSp -- The number of siblings and spouses the passenger had on board.\n",
    "- Parch -- The number of parents and children the passenger had on board.\n",
    "- Ticket -- The ticket number of the passenger.\n",
    "- Fare -- How much the passenger paid for the ticker.\n",
    "- Cabin -- Which cabin the passenger was in.\n",
    "- Embarked -- Where the passenger boarded the Titanic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good first step is to think logically about the columns and what we're trying to predict. What variables might logically affect the outcome of survived? (reading more about the Titanic might help here).\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that women and children were more likely to survive. Thus, Age and Sex are probably good predictors. It's also logical to think that passenger class might affect the outcome, as first class cabins were closer to the deck of the ship. Fare is tied to passenger class, and will probably be highly correlated with it, but might add some additional information. Number of siblings and parents/children will probably be correlated with survival one way or the other, as either there are more people to help you, or more people to think about and try to save.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a less clear link between survival and columns like Embarked (maybe there is some information about how close to the top of the ship people's cabins were here), Ticket, and Name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is generally known as acquiring domain knowledge, and it fairly important to most machine learning tasks. We're looking to engineer the features so that we maximize the information we have about what we're trying to predict."
